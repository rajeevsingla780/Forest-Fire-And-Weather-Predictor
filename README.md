# Foresty

# Nowadays, forest fires became one of the foremost important problems that cause damage to several areas around the world.

This webapp can be used to predict the probability of forest fire by entering the forest and the location.
## Built Using
* Flask API - hosted on Heroku
* sklearn for predicting and sklearn for pre-processing
* JS and HTML for the websites
* Darksky API for the weather data
* Pandas, Numpy for csv reading, linear algebra respectively.
* Integrated and hosted on Heroku
## How it works
* When the user clicks the button on the web page, the Darksky API  sent the latitude and longitude
of the place entered and collects the raw data of the forest.
* The python script then fetches weather data from the Darksky API.
* This data is used to calculate the Humidity, Temperature and Oxygen.
  
## Requirements
* `sklearn` for machine learning
* `flask`, `flask-cors` for the API
* `numpy` for linear algebra
* `pandas` for reading the training data in the form of `*.csv`

## Methodology
First, I made my own dataset from analysing various factors and conditions and got to know 
for the detection of a wildfire is primarily dependent upon 3 factors  
Oxygen Level: For any fire to take place, high oxygen content is required. So higher the oxygen more is the probability of a wildfire taking place  
Temperature: Obviously for a fire to take place, heat is favourable. Hence high temperature increases the probability of fire in any region.  
Humidity: Obviously Humid weather is unfavourable for a fire, whereas a dry weather is. Therefore, higher the humidity, lower the probability of a fire taking place.

In our prediction system, the user provides the location of a forest and the country where it's located. This user input is used to fetch the data of temperature, humidity, and wind speed from a Weather API after processing it through a geolocator. This data is used in our prediction model to predict the probability of a potential forest fire. The chosen parameters are found to be highly correlated with a history of forest fire occurrences. We have built a predictor function that takes a set of weather condition data as a JSON object and returns a prediction generated by the trained  logistic regression model. Now we can pass the predictor a set of values that represent a forest fire that starts at a given location under a given set of weather conditions and use it to predict the burning probability of said forest fire. Since we obtain the highest accuracy of Logistic Regression, we opt that model.

Dependencies in our product include - DarkSkyAPI for Weather Data, Geopy for Geocoding the location and Sklearn for Machine Learning. Other dependencies include Numpy, Pandas, Flask, wtforms, Bootstrap etc.

When this concept is deployed, we created a web application that simply takes 2 inputs from the user to get the forest fire probability. 


## Novelty of Work
The recent work has been done on the dataset available on kaggle but real time prediction has not done yet but our model works on real time data which we get through weather API (Darksky API). Our model is trained on the three important parameters namely Oxygen, Humidity and Temperature and different models were trained and logistic regression gave the best results. 
The dataset is build using the dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/
